        'title': '2. What Opportunity Zones Are',
        'content': '''
        <p>Opportunity Zones are economically distressed communities where new investments may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. Created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, these zones are designed to spur economic development and job creation in low-income communities across the United States.</p>
        
        <div class="chart-container">

        </div>
        
        <h3>Designation Process</h3>
        <p>Opportunity Zones are nominated by state governors and certified by the U.S. Treasury Department. Each state can nominate up to 25% of its low-income census tracts, with a minimum of 25 zones per state.</p>
        
        <div class="sidebar-box">
            <h3>Twin Benefits</h3>
            <p>Opportunity Zones provide dual advantages: significant tax benefits for investors and meaningful economic development for underserved communities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Geographic Distribution</h3>
        <p>Over 8,700 Opportunity Zones exist across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories. These zones represent diverse markets, from urban cores to rural communities.</p>

        'title': '3. The Tax Advantage Framework',
        'content': '''
        <p>The Opportunity Zone tax framework provides three distinct benefits that can significantly enhance after-tax returns for qualified investments.</p>
        
        <h3>Tax Deferral</h3>
        <p>Capital gains invested in Opportunity Zones are deferred until December 31, 2026, or until the investment is sold, whichever comes first. This deferral provides immediate liquidity benefits and allows for compound growth on the deferred tax liability.</p>
        
        <h3>Tax Reduction</h3>
        <p>5-Year Hold: 10% reduction in deferred gains<br>
        7-Year Hold: 15% reduction in deferred gains<br>
        Maximum Benefit: Achieved by holding until December 31, 2026</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>Tax-Free Appreciation</h3>
        <p>The most significant benefit is the complete elimination of capital gains tax on appreciation for investments held for 10 or more years.</p>
        
        <div class="callout-box">
            <h3>Illustrative Example: $2M â†’ $5M Growth</h3>
            <p>Original gain: $2M (deferred until 2026)<br>
            Investment appreciation: $3M (tax-free after 10 years)<br>
            Total tax savings: $600K+ (assuming 20% capital gains rate)</p>

        <h3>90% Asset Test</h3>
        <p>Qualified Opportunity Funds must maintain at least 90% of their assets in Opportunity Zone property. This test is measured semi-annually and requires careful asset allocation management.</p>

        <h3>Safe Harbor Provisions</h3>
        <p>Safe harbor rules provide flexibility for working capital and development activities, allowing up to 31 months for property improvement and business development within Opportunity Zones.</p>
        
        <h3>Substantial Improvement Requirements</h3>
        <p>Existing property must be substantially improved, defined as doubling the adjusted basis of the property through improvements within 30 months of acquisition.</p>
        
        <h3>IRS Scrutiny and Documentation</h3>
        <p>Comprehensive documentation is essential for IRS compliance, including detailed records of asset allocation, improvement activities, and business operations within Opportunity Zones.</p>

        <h3>Qualified Opportunity Fund Structures</h3>
        <p>QOFs can be structured as partnerships, corporations, or LLCs, each offering different advantages for tax treatment, management flexibility, and investor liquidity.</p>
        
        <h3>Institutional vs. Self-Managed</h3>
        <p>Institutional QOFs provide professional management and diversification, while self-managed QOFs offer greater control and potentially lower fees for sophisticated investors.</p>
        
        <h3>Fee Structures</h3>
        <p>Typical fee structures include management fees (1-2% annually), performance fees (10-20% of profits), and acquisition fees (1-3% of invested capital).</p>
        
        <h3>Minimum Investment Requirements</h3>
        <p>Minimum investments typically range from $25,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the fund structure and target investor base.</p>

        <h3>Asset Class Advantages</h3>
        <p>Real estate represents approximately 75% of Opportunity Zone investments due to its tangible nature, predictable cash flows, and alignment with community development goals.</p>

        <h3>Development Opportunities</h3>
        <p>Opportunity Zones often contain underutilized or vacant properties suitable for redevelopment, creating value through improvement and repositioning.</p>
        
        <h3>Cash Flow Generation</h3>
        <p>Real estate investments can generate immediate cash flow through rental income, providing ongoing returns while benefiting from tax advantages.</p>
        
        <h3>Appreciation Potential</h3>
        <p>The combination of community development and economic growth in Opportunity Zones creates significant appreciation potential over the 10-year hold period.</p>
