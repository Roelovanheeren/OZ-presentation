    <h2>9.2 Investment Process</h2>
    
    <h3>Due Diligence Framework</h3>
    <p>QOZB investments require enhanced due diligence covering business fundamentals, regulatory compliance, market positioning, and operational capabilities. The complexity of QOZB qualification necessitates specialized legal and tax expertise throughout the investment process.</p>

    
    <h3>Risk Management</h3>
    <p>Operating business investments carry additional risks compared to real estate including market competition, operational execution, management quality, and business model viability. These risks must be balanced against potentially superior returns and portfolio diversification benefits.</p>
    
    <h3>Performance Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Active monitoring of QOZB compliance requires ongoing assessment of income sources, asset locations, business activities, and regulatory requirements. Investment committees must maintain oversight of both financial performance and regulatory compliance.</p>
    
    <h3>Exit Planning</h3>
    <p>QOZB exit strategies include strategic sales, management buyouts, public offerings, or recapitalization transactions. The 10-year holding period requirement necessitates careful exit planning to maximize tax benefits while achieving optimal valuation outcomes.</p>
