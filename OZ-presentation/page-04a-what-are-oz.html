    <h2>2.2 Investment Structure</h2>
    
    <h3>Economic Impact Theory</h3>
    <p>The program is based on place-based economic development theory, which suggests that targeted investment in distressed areas can generate positive spillover effects, job creation, and sustained economic growth. Research from previous programs like Empowerment Zones provides the empirical foundation for the OZ structure.</p>

    
    <h3>Investment Vehicle Structure</h3>
    <p>Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) serve as the exclusive investment vehicles for accessing tax benefits. QOFs are investment vehicles organized as corporations or partnerships that hold at least 90% of their assets in Qualified Opportunity Zone Property (QOZP).</p>
    
    <h3>Eligible Property Types</h3>
    <p>QOZP includes Qualified Opportunity Zone Stock, Qualified Opportunity Zone Partnership Interest, and Qualified Opportunity Zone Business Property. Each category has specific requirements for original use, acquisition timing, and substantial improvement thresholds.</p>
    
    <h3>Capital Requirements</h3>
    <p>The substantial improvement test requires that additional investment in existing property must equal or exceed the purchase price within 30 months. This requirement ensures meaningful capital deployment and prevents speculation on existing assets without value creation.</p>
