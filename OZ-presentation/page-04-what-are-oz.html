    <h2>2. Understanding Opportunity Zones</h2>
    
    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
    <p>Opportunity Zones represent the most significant community development tax incentive in U.S. history. Established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the program creates powerful tax incentives for long-term private investment in low-income communities nationwide.</p>
    

    
    <h3>Legislative Foundation</h3>
    <p>The bipartisan legislation, championed by Senators Tim Scott and Cory Booker, addresses persistent economic inequality by channeling private capital to underserved areas. The program builds on decades of research showing that targeted investment can catalyze sustainable community revitalization.</p>
    
    <div class="sidebar-box">
        <h3>Key Statistics</h3>
        <p>8,764 designated zones across all 50 states, DC, and five territories. Approximately 35 million residents live in designated Opportunity Zones, representing 11% of the U.S. population.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Geographic Scope</h3>
    <p>Zones span diverse geographies from urban cores in major metropolitan areas to rural communities in distressed regions. Each state nominated up to 25% of eligible low-income census tracts, creating a national network of investment-ready communities.</p>
    
    <h3>Designation Criteria</h3>
    <p>Eligible census tracts must have poverty rates of at least 20% or median family incomes not exceeding 80% of area median income. Adjacent tracts to qualified zones may also be designated if they have median family incomes not exceeding 125% of area median income.</p>
