    <h2>5. Compliance Framework (cont.)</h2>
    
    <h3>Operational Procedures</h3>
    <p>Successful compliance requires robust operational infrastructure including specialized accounting systems, legal compliance monitoring, regulatory reporting capabilities, and ongoing asset management protocols. QOFs must maintain detailed records supporting all compliance positions.</p>

    
    <h3>Working Capital Safe Harbor</h3>
    <p>The working capital safe harbor provides 31 months for deployment of cash received from investors, subject to reasonable written schedule and plan requirements. This safe harbor is critical for maintaining 90% asset test compliance during deployment periods.</p>
    
    <h3>Substantial Improvement Rules</h3>
    <p>Existing property acquisitions must satisfy substantial improvement requirements where additional investment equals or exceeds the purchase price within 30 months. Original use property is not subject to substantial improvement requirements, creating strategic acquisition advantages.</p>
    
    <h3>Business Asset Requirements</h3>
    <p>QOZ businesses must derive at least 50% of gross income from active conduct of trade or business within the OZ, maintain substantial use of tangible property within the zone, and satisfy specific asset ownership thresholds. These requirements necessitate careful business structure planning.</p>
