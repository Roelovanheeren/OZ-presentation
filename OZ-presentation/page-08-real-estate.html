    <h2>7. Real Estate Investments</h2>
    
    <h3>Market Dominance Rationale</h3>
    <p>Real estate represents approximately 90% of OZ investments due to regulatory clarity, established operational frameworks, and favorable compliance characteristics. The asset class benefits from original use treatment for ground-up development and clear valuation methodologies for substantial improvement calculations.</p>

    
    <h3>Multifamily Residential</h3>
    <p>Multifamily development and repositioning dominate OZ real estate strategies, particularly in high-growth metropolitan areas with strong demographic tailwinds. The asset class provides stable cash flow, predictable appreciation, and multiple exit strategies including sale to institutional buyers.</p>
    
    <div class="sidebar-box">
        <h3>Preferred Property Types</h3>
        <p>• Build-to-Rent Single-Family: Institutional ownership of rental homes<br>
        • Multifamily Development: Ground-up apartment construction<br>
        • Mixed-Use Projects: Combining residential, retail, and office<br>
        • Industrial/Logistics: E-commerce and distribution facilities</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Development Strategy Advantages</h3>
    <p>Ground-up construction provides maximum regulatory flexibility as original use property, eliminating substantial improvement requirements and providing clearest path to compliance. Development projects also offer highest value creation potential through entitlement, construction, and lease-up phases.</p>
    
    <h3>Geographic Concentration</h3>
    <p>Successful real estate strategies focus on select high-growth markets with strong economic fundamentals, population growth, job creation, and favorable regulatory environments. Market selection is critical for maximizing risk-adjusted returns and ensuring long-term value creation.</p>
